These files contain example configurations for the phases studied in the Lammps input format.

For some phases, we provide several example configurations, although this is not an exhaustive list of all the configurations we have considered.

The phases labelled 'iceIII' and 'iceV' correspond to a random choice of proton disorder; the appropriate partially disordered structures, with occupancies consistent with experiment, are labelled 'iceIII-part' and 'iceV-part'.

The phase labelled 12111 corresponds to the cubic analogue of ice XI.
