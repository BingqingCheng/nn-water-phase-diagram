This directory contains the Mathematica notebook used to compute the phase diagram (free-energy-H2O.nb), as well as all the underlying data that are read from within the notebook.

The directory 'chemical-potential-output' contains chemical potential data generated by the Mathematica notebook, as labelled.

The directories 'ice-nnp2dft-*results' contain the MLP->DFT corrections for the DFT functionals indicated. The directory without a label corresponds to the revPBE0-D3 functional.

The directory 'ice-pimd-results' contains the centroid virial kinetic energies for the systems as labelled. The subdirectory 'split-up-by-y/split-up-by-PT' contains the NQE corrections as a function of temperature and pressure, as labelled.

The directories 'isobarOutput' and 'isothermOutput' contain thermodynamic integration data along isotherms and isobars for the MLP for various phases. The first row of each file identifies the columns. In these files, all per-particle properties are reported per atom, rather than per molecule.

The file 'extracted-data.wl' contains reference chemical potentials obtained from thermodynamic integration at a range of temperatures.

The file 'allTypes.dat' lists all the phases considered.
